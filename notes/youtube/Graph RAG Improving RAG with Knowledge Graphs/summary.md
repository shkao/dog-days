### Summary

The seminar explains how Microsoft's newly open-sourced system, GraphRag, improves upon traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating knowledge graphs. While GraphRag addresses several limitations of traditional RAG systems, such as limited contextual understanding and scalability issues, it comes with a significant cost implication, particularly when processing large datasets. The guide walks through the steps to set up GraphRag on a local machine, covering the indexing phase, query phase, and cost analysis. It also mentions alternative implementations by other companies.

### Detailed Notes

#### Introduction to GraphRag

- Microsoft open-sourced GraphRag, presented about a year ago.
- Combines knowledge graphs with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Enhances the performance of traditional RAG systems.
- Available on GitHub.
- Compatible with proprietary models like GPT-4 and local models like LAMA3.

#### Traditional RAG Approach

- **Indexing Phase:**
  1. Process documents and convert them into vectors via embeddings.
  2. Store chunks and embeddings in a vector store as the knowledge base.
- **Query Phase:**
  1. Compute query embeddings.
  2. Perform similarity search to retrieve relevant chunks.
  3. Combine query with retrieved context for the language model to generate the final response.
  
- **Limitations:**
  1. Limited contextual understanding.
  2. Scalability issues.
  3. Complexity in integrating external knowledge sources.

#### GraphRag Approach

- **Indexing Phase:**
  1. Similar initial steps as in traditional RAG.
  2. Identify entities within chunks and their relationships.
  3. Create a knowledge graph from entities and relationships.
  4. Form communities by detecting entities that are related and create multi-level summaries.
  
- **Query Phase:**
  1. User query selects community level (global/local).
  2. Retrieve partial responses from relevant communities and combine them for the final answer.

#### Technical Documentation

- Detailed technical report titled "From Local to Global: A GraphRag Approach to Query-Focused Summarization."
- Provides in-depth technical flow and entity relationships.

#### Setting Up GraphRag

- Create a Conda virtual environment and activate it.
- Install GraphRag using pip.
- Prepare a dataset (current support for plain text, e.g., 'A Christmas Carol' from Project Gutenberg).
- Initialize configurations and create an index from the dataset.
- Numerous configurations can be set, including OpenAI API keys, chunk sizes, and token overlaps.
- Inputs like embedded models can be tailored to preferences, local models, or OpenAIâ€™s.
- Prompts for entity extraction and summarization can be modified.

#### Running Index and Query

- Creates a structured knowledge graph and outputs logs and JSON files.
- Allows running queries at different community levels (global for themes, local for specific characters).
- Provides references for responses, citing sources.

#### Cost Implication

- Significant cost due to numerous API requests and token processing.
- Example: Processing 'A Christmas Carol' cost around $7 with well over 1 million tokens, indicating it could be expensive for larger datasets.

#### Alternative Implementations

- Other companies like Lama Index and Neo4j have their variations of GraphRag.
- Possible future content comparison among different implementations.

#### Conclusion

- GraphRag addresses limitations of traditional RAG but involves higher costs.
- Encouraged to explore the system and its detailed technical documentation.
- Future content might explore comparisons with other GraphRag implementations.
