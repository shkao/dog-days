### Summary:

In this video, the presenter discusses the use of local models with Project GraphRack, a framework from Microsoft that integrates knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Unlike the previous video where GPT-4-O was used, the current video focuses on utilizing local models through Ollama and the Grok API. The presenter provides a step-by-step guide to setting up these local models and discusses their performance and limitations compared to larger models like GPT-4-O.

### Detailed Notes:

**1. **Introduction to Project GraphRack:**
   - Aim: Combining knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
   - Previous Video: Used GPT-4-O, expensive but effective.
   
**2. Using Local Models:**
   - Tools: Ollama and Grok API.
   - Local Model Used: LLama 3 (recommend using bigger models if hardware supports).

**3. Setting Up Ollama:**
   - Download Ollama on local machine.
   - Models: Using LLama 3.
   - Approach: Ollama follows OpenAI API standards for easy transition.
   - API Details: Default at `localhost:11434/v1`, with API key as `Ollama`.

**4. Project Configuration:**
   - Configuration File: `settings.yml`.
   - Changes Needed:
     - API Key: Change from OpenAI (GraphLag) to Ollama.
     - Model: Set to `LLama3`.
     - JSON Mode: Enable if necessary.
     - API Endpoint: Set to local machine endpoint.

**5. Using Grok API:**
   - Change API Key to Grok API endpoint.
   - Adjust Rate Limits: Grok free tier allows max 30 requests per minute.
   - Models: E.g., Lama 370 billion.
   
**6. Embedding Models:**
   - Challenges: Difficulty in replacing OpenAI embedding models due to lack of standard API.
   - Cost Consideration: Embedding model costs are minimal compared to LLM costs.
   
**7. Index Creation and Model Execution:**
   - Command: Use `python-m graphrank.index` to create the index.
   - File Paths: Adjust file paths and settings as needed.
   
**8. Performance and Comparison:**
   - System Used: M2 MacBook Pro (96 GB RAM).
   - Performance: Slower on local models, especially on entity extraction.
   - Observation: LAMA3 8 billion vs. GPT-4-0.
     - Smaller LLMs struggle with accurate entity extraction and relationship formation.
     - Bigger LLMs like LAMA 370 billion provide better results but still not as good as GPT-4-0.
   
**9. Running Queries:**
   - Example: `python-m graphrag.query` with specific prompts.
   - Results: Quality varies significantly with model used.

**10. Importance of Prompt Engineering:**
   - Different LLMs react differently to the same prompt.
   - Handcrafting prompts for each LLM is crucial for optimized results.

**11. Conclusion and Future Work:**
   - Experimentation: More work needed to explore the full potential of GraphRag.
   - Mention: Upcoming exploration of other GraphRag implementations.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Model Size Matters:** Larger LLMs like GPT-4-O yield better results in extracting entities and forming relationships.
- **Cost Consideration:** Embedding models cost less compared to LLM invocations, even if using OpenAI embedding models.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Essential to tailor prompts for each LLM to achieve the best results.
- **Future Exploration:** Continued experimentation and analysis on GraphRag and other implementations are forthcoming.

### Steps to Set Up and Run:

1. **Download and Install Ollama:**
   - Configure API endpoint (`localhost:11434/v1`).
   - Use LLama 3 as the model.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Modify `settings.yml` to point to Ollama or Grok API.
   - Update API keys and model names accordingly.
   
3. **Run Indexing:**
   - Command: `python-m graphrank.index`.
   
4. **Run Queries:**
   - Command: `python-m graphrag.query`.
   - Adjust and craft prompts specifically for the model in use.

### Limitations & Challenges:
- **Hardware Dependency:** Bigger models require more computing power.
- **Rate Limits:** Free tiers like Grok have restrictive rate limits affecting performance.
- **Embedding Model Compatibility:** Issues replacing OpenAI embedding models due to non-standard APIs.

By utilizing Ollama and Grok API, it's possible to transition from expensive cloud-based LLMs to local models for certain applications, but careful consideration of model size, rate limits, and prompt engineering is crucial for optimal performance.
